I started with the pdf, using Preview in mac I selected regions and
copied and created new doc, saved it as jpeg and then used
the online OCR program: http://asv.aso.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/tesseract/
I then manually edited each file.

The files are named according to the page index in the pdf and the
section and page given in the page footer.  Page headers and footers
were not captured.

e00-01 
    - I used spaces to line up the comment columns, not tabs.  I
      picked the column distance arbitrarily.
    - the bottom section looks like it could be tabbed but my tabstops
      didnt line up with the values given so I used spaces

e00-02
    - I used tabs for the start of each asm command but not for the
      separation between mnemonic and arguments since these didnt line up.
      with my tab stops.

e00-03
    - left "dis addresses" typo in per original

e00-05
    - cant tell if the "O" in quotes after 1: is a O or a 0.
    - left mispelled "mormally" in comment
    - left "file/etc/init" without space.

e00-06
    - left mis-spacing on 5: move r5,r1.

e00-10
    - left "/ect/init" typo
--------------------
e10-01
e10-02
   - I used tabs for the first tab stop and spaced out to the next step.
   - Per discussions with Brantley Coile it appears that the origianl
     source probably used tabs, and that the printout has a tab stop
     after 8 characters and another after 7 characters.  The spaces
     between opcode and operands are probably due to a tab, as can be
     seen in later assembly code we have in machine readable form.
